#Writting is a craft

It starts at school where I told myself I don't have a "gift for words". I feel common affliction: fear of writting. In the other site after these all years I see that writing is a craft, and I can learn of it based on principles.

From time when I shift to remote working, the ability to communicate clearly in written form becomes more essencial that ever. Writting has a two brilliant ways. It is building my personal brand, and in the process it forced me to learn and develop. Bingo!

I would aspire to work in developer relations, to establish myself as a conference speaker or I don't know even dream of authoring a book for tech publisher one day, writing is crucial to achieving those ambition.

I think, as an engineer, I am drawn to challenging problems. Let me split it for small chunks as usuall. There are also some striking parallers between writing and programming. As with programming, I get better at writting with practice. As with programming I often learn new writing techniques through imitation. Similar with programming, writing has patterns that can be useful. Even though I can spend a whole day struggling with a problem in an article - or with a part of code, only to figure it out immediately after a break.

I frankly believe that I need to get better at sharing my knowledge, and writing articles is a key way to do this. Whith this in mind, I'll start by breaking down my writting process.
