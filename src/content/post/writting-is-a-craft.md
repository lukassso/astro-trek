It all began at school when I convinced myself that I didn't possess a 'gift for words.' I shared a common affliction: a fear of writing. However, over the years, I've come to realize that writing is a craft, something I can learn based on principles.

From time when I shift to remote working, the ability to communicate clearly in written form becomes more essencial than ever. Writing has a two brilliant ways. It is building my personal brand, and in the process it forced me to learn and develop. Isn't it beautiful? That's exactly what I needed.

I aspire to work in developer relations, establishing myself as a conference speaker. Perhaps, I might even dream of authoring a book for a tech publisher one day. Writing is crucial to achieving these ambitions.

I believe, as an engineer, I am naturally drawn to challenging problems. Let me break it down into smaller chunks, as usual. Interestingly, there are striking parallels between writing and programming. Similar to programming, my writing skills improve with practice. I often learn new writing techniques through imitation, just as I do with programming. Like programming, writing has observable patterns that can be quite useful. For example, when I spend an entire day struggling with a problem in an article or a section of code, I often find a solution immediately after taking a break.

I frankly believe that I need to get better at sharing my knowledge, and writing articles is a key way to do this. With this in mind, I'll start by breaking down my writing process.

As a beginner, I'm going to share my thoughts on the writing process, drawing parallels between the art of writing and the analytical mindset of a programmer.

## Starting the writing process

I reminded myself to commence the writing process by carefully considering my target audience. This involves pondering questions such as "What do they already know?" and "How much explanation is necessary?"

The identified target groups include:

Senior developers transitioning into their initial leadership role.
Junior developers embarking on their first or second job.
Developers seeking answers for specific algorithms or patterns in solutions.
Understanding the audience is crucial for identifying unfamiliar terms and tailoring the content accordingly. If a term is unfamiliar, a brief definition or a link can be provided. Considering the possibility of numerous terms, creating a glossary is a prudent option.

Once the audience is defined, I then determine the role I am assuming for that reader. Am I a reporter, an educator, or just an average programmer? At this point, I am seriously considering incorporating tags with these roles. I pose questions to myself such as "How much ground do I want to cover?" and "What is the key message I wish to convey?" My approach is to think small, focusing on one specific aspect of the subject and covering it thoroughly.

The subsequent query revolves around the nature of the writing itself. I adopt a strategic approach, setting a word budget based on the type of content. For instance, I allocate around 500 words for announcements regarding new tools or products, providing a concise overview. Blog posts typically fall within the range of 1000-2000 words, a standard I've encountered. Tutorials, especially those featuring numerous code samples, and written interviews or profiles may extend beyond this range. Longer articles can be efficiently divided into two or more parts for better readability and engagement.

## Initiating the Writing Process

As I delve into the writing process, I must address several upfront decisions to ensure a cohesive and effective outcome. One such decision involves choosing the narrative perspective: should I write in the third person or the first person, adopting the role of an observer or a participant? While the conventional approach may lean toward the past tense, I recognize the importance of experimenting with the present tense for a more vivid and engaging narrative.

Another crucial aspect is the potential need for multiple sources and conducting interviews to gather insightful quotes. Establishing a robust network becomes instrumental at this juncture. Recognizing its significance, I am committed to continually expanding my web contacts. Interviews can take various forms, including email correspondence, video calls, or phone discussions. It is prudent to seek the subject's permission and consider recording video interviews for accuracy. Additionally, the utilization of voice-to-text transcription tools is a viable option, simplifying the process of quoting sources accurately.

Acknowledging my initial concerns about the article's perceived complexity, I aim to strike a balance between comprehensive insights and beginner-friendly guidance in these paragraphs. The decisions discussed here are pivotal for shaping the tone and structure of the writing process, ensuring a coherent and engaging piece for readers at all levels.

## Let's Begin Drafting

When I embark on a writing piece, my approach involves not overthinking the initial stages. I start by gathering words on the screen without dwelling too much on the details, shaping them into a draft at a later stage. Developing the skill to discard material that doesn't meet the desired standard is crucial, leading to the often-needed removal of the initial paragraphs in the first draft.

For the second draft, I prefer using Google Docs due to its support for tracked changes and versioning, making the editing process more manageable. The platform also facilitates comments and collaboration. To convert the content efficiently, I rely on the open-source "Docs to Markdown" plug-in. Although not entirely bug-free, it generally does an excellent job of transferring text from Google Docs into HTML and Markdown formats.

In this phase, which is the second draft, I begin contemplating the structure of the piece. Understanding my target reader becomes particularly valuable at this point. Questions such as "What would this person want to know first?" guiding me in organizing the content to enhance reader engagement.

Before finalizing and submitting the piece, I follow a practice of sending the draft to individuals I've interviewed. This step ensures that they are content with how their quotes are presented, fostering collaboration and maintaining accuracy in the content.

As a developing writer, this iterative approach allows me to refine my work and tailor it to the needs of my audience, addressing my concerns about the article's accessibility and complexity

## Recognizing the Conclusion

Determining when to conclude a piece is a crucial aspect of the writing process. As I reach the final stage, typically marked by the inclusion of a "conclusion" subheading or a similar phrase like 'To sum up..', it signifies that the reader has traversed the entire article. A well-crafted ending should seamlessly feel like a natural stopping point.

Having covered the fundamentals, this juncture serves as the opportune moment to bring my considerations to a close.

## Concluding Thoughts

In reflection, writing is a realm that accommodates not only those with innate talent but also individuals fueled by deep motivation to share thoughts and enhance their proficiency in the 'English' language, a potential programming language in the future. As a beginner navigating this domain, the journey involves a commitment to continuous improvement and a dedication to articulating ideas effectively.

These concluding thoughts encapsulate the essence of my exploration into writing, echoing my initial concerns and aspirations as I strive to evolve in this craft.
