#Writting is a craft

It all began at school when I convinced myself that I didn't possess a 'gift for words.' I shared a common affliction: a fear of writing. However, over the years, I've come to realize that writing is a craft, something I can learn based on principles.

From time when I shift to remote working, the ability to communicate clearly in written form becomes more essencial than ever. Writing has a two brilliant ways. It is building my personal brand, and in the process it forced me to learn and develop. Isn't it beautiful? That's exactly what I needed.

I aspire to work in developer relations, establishing myself as a conference speaker. Perhaps, I might even dream of authoring a book for a tech publisher one day. Writing is crucial to achieving these ambitions.

I believe, as an engineer, I am naturally drawn to challenging problems. Let me break it down into smaller chunks, as usual. Interestingly, there are striking parallels between writing and programming. Similar to programming, my writing skills improve with practice. I often learn new writing techniques through imitation, just as I do with programming. Like programming, writing has observable patterns that can be quite useful. For example, when I spend an entire day struggling with a problem in an article or a section of code, I often find a solution immediately after taking a break.

I frankly believe that I need to get better at sharing my knowledge, and writing articles is a key way to do this. With this in mind, I'll start by breaking down my writing process.
